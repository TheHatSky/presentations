  <h1>X things about Development</h1>
  <p>I've learned while being a Product Owner</p>
</div>

<!--
Hey everyone, I'm Artem, and here we are, gathered together to chat about software development.
Now, I know we're all friends here, so if you have a question, just raise your hand -- I'll be answering them pretty regularly.

As someone who's been in the world of software development as both a developer and a product owner, I've gotta say, it has affected drastically on how I develop products.

So, today, I thought it'd be cool to share with you all some of the juiciest insights I've picked up. We're talking about the stuff they don't teach you on CodeAcademy â€” the lessons learned from being in the trenches.

Now, let's kick back, relax, and explore these nuggets of wisdom together. Get ready for some laughs, some "aha" moments, and maybe even a few head nods of agreement.

Sound good? Alrighty then, let's set sail!

# What were my responsibilities?

<div class="pt-10">
<v-clicks>

  - ðŸ› ðŸ’» **Hacking the product**
  - ðŸ¤¹ðŸ§‘ **Meeting clients**
  - ðŸ“ˆðŸ’° **Owning P&L**
  - ðŸ”®ðŸ§™ **Vision discovery**

</v-clicks>
</div>

<!--
So, what were my responsibilities?

[click] First there was the exciting task of hacking the productâ€”of rolling up my sleeves and diving headfirst into the world of data, UX, and code. From brainstorming new features and troubleshooting bugs to collaborating with new subcontractors and external design teams, every day spent tinkering with the product was a lesson on it's own.
 
[click] Then, I had the privilege of meeting with clientsâ€”individuals from organizations whom we could help with our product. These meetings were more than just discussions; they were opportunities to understand needs, and to build (or ruin) relationships grounded in trust and collaboration.

[click] But meeting clients was just the beginning. I also had the responsibility for the profits and losses, being entrusted with the financial health and prosperity of our product. It was a responsibility that demanded foresight, strategic thinking, and a keen eye for opportunity -- all of which I somewhat lacked at the beginning. Yet, it was also a privilegeâ€”a testament to the trust placed in me by my team and stakeholders.

[click] But perhaps my most at time undervalued responsibility was that of vision discovery. With time passing we've expanded our core product with supportive add-ons, which later grew into separate products. More product owners joined our team, and more teams spawned, so we had to have a concise vision that would help all of us to align.

<h2 style="font-size: 44px; line-height:50px">Plans are worthless, <br/><span style="color:transparent">re-</span>planning is essential</h2>

Lesson I

<!--
Alright, let's explore a timeless lesson in software development: the nature of plans and planning.

Now, that's a common thing still worth repeating.

Plans feel like a mapâ€”they give you a sense of direction and guide you, but they're not set in stone. In the ever-changing landscape of software development, sticking too rigidly to a plan can be a recipe for disaster.
-->

<!--
That's where planning comes in. Planning is not just about creating a static document and following it blindlyâ€”it's about the process of thinking, strategizing, and preparing for the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.

By engaging in the planning process, you're not just outlining a series of steps to followâ€”you're also cultivating a mindset of adaptability and resilience. You're anticipating potential roadblocks and devising contingency plans to overcome them. You're collaborating with your team to brainstorm creative solutions and iterate on your approach as needed.

But here's the kicker: no matter how meticulously you plan, things will inevitably go south. Requirements will change, deadlines will shift, clients will drop out, and unexpected obstacles will crop up when you least expect them.

<h2 style="font-size: 44px; line-height:50px">Plans are worthless, <br/><span v-click v-mark.red>re-</span>planning is essential</h2>

Lesson I

<!--
And that's where the true value of planning comes into play. It's not about sticking to a rigid plan no matter whatâ€”it's about being prepared to pivot and adapt when the situation calls for it. It's about having the flexibility to overcome uncertainty and turn challenges into opportunities.

So, the next time you find yourself knee-deep in the planning process, remember: plans are useless, planning is important, but re-planning is essential. Embrace the process, stay agile, and be prepared to roll.

<h2 style="font-size: 44px; line-height:50px">Build to throw away</h2>
Lesson II

<!--
Having learned one of the ways of adaptability, 

Alright, folks, let's talk about one of the golden rules of software development: building in a way that you can easily throw away. Now, I know what you're probably thinking: "Wait, why would I want to throw away something I've spent time and resources building?" Bear with me, and I'll explain.

Change is the only constant. Requirements shift, technology evolves, and user feedback can send you back to the drawing board in one emial. So, it's crucial to adopt a mindset of flexibility and adaptability in your development process.

Instead of clinging to your code like a shipwreck survivor to a raft, think of it more as a draft.

You want your code to be modular, scalable, and easy to dismantle and rearrange if needed. This means writing clean, well-documented code, embracing design patterns and best practices, and avoiding tightly-coupled dependencies like the plague.

By building with the mindset of "throwing away," you're not only future-proofing your codebase but also empowering your team to innovate and iterate with confidence. Need to pivot direction? No problem, you've built your code in a way that allows for seamless transitions and minimal disruption.

Now, I'm not saying you should be reckless and toss out your code willy-nilly at the first sign of trouble. No, it's about being proactive and intentional in your development approach. Think of it as building a sturdy foundation for a houseâ€”you want it to withstand the test of time and weather any storm that comes your way.

So, the next time you sit down to write some code, ask yourself: Is this something I can easily throw away and rebuild if needed? If the answer is yes, then you're on the right track to building software that's not just robust but also adaptable to whatever the future may hold.

# Table of contents

You can use the `Toc` component to generate a table of contents for your slides:

```html
<Toc minDepth="1" maxDepth="1"></Toc>
```

The title will be inferred from your slide content, or you can override it with `title` and `level` in your frontmatter.

::right::

<Toc v-click minDepth="1" maxDepth="2"></Toc>

# Shiki Magic Move

Powered by [shiki-magic-move](https://shiki-magic-move.netlify.app/), Slidev supports animations across multiple code snippets.

Add multiple code blocks and wrap them with <code>````md magic-move</code> (four backticks) to enable the magic move. For example:

````md magic-move
```ts {*|2|*}
// step 1
const author = reactive({
  name: 'John Doe',
  books: [
    'Vue 2 - Advanced Guide',
    'Vue 3 - Basic Guide',
    'Vue 4 - The Mystery'
  ]
})
```

```ts {*|1-2|3-4|3-4,8}
// step 2
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      author: {
        name: 'John Doe',
        books: [
          'Vue 2 - Advanced Guide',
          'Vue 3 - Basic Guide',
          'Vue 4 - The Mystery'
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```ts
// step 3
export default {
  data: () => ({
    author: {
      name: 'John Doe',
      books: [
        'Vue 2 - Advanced Guide',
        'Vue 3 - Basic Guide',
        'Vue 4 - The Mystery'
      ]
    }
  })
}
```

Non-code blocks are ignored.

```vue
<!-- step 4 -->
<script setup>
const author = {
  name: 'John Doe',
  books: [
    'Vue 2 - Advanced Guide',
    'Vue 3 - Basic Guide',
    'Vue 4 - The Mystery'
  ]
}
</script>
```

# Monaco Editor

Slidev provides built-in Monaco Editor support.

Add `{monaco}` to the code block to turn it into an editor:

```ts {monaco}
import { ref } from 'vue'
import { emptyArray } from './external'

const arr = ref(emptyArray(10))
```

Use `{monaco-run}` to create an editor that can execute the code directly in the slide:

```ts {monaco-run}
import { version } from 'vue'
import { emptyArray, sayHello } from './external'

sayHello()
console.log(`vue ${version}`)
console.log(emptyArray<number>(10).reduce(fib => [...fib, fib.at(-1)! + fib.at(-2)!], [1, 1]))
```
